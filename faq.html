                            <h4>What are forgings?</h4> 
                            
                            Forgings are steel parts made by heating steel to a forgeable temperature (ex. 2400 degrees Fahrenheit) and using a high tonnage press to form the steel between impression dies. This process reduces the amount of steel needed to create the final component. The process creates less waste for the environment and increases the strength of the steel component. 
                            <br><br>
                            <h4>What does Upset Forging mean?</h4>
                         
                            Upset forging is a manufacturing process, not our state of mind. In the upset forging process, one end of a steel bar gets heated and then forged. The rest of the bar remains outside of the forging die cavity allowing a single side to be forged according to the shape of the die cavity. This allows for greater efficiency and is beneficial for component configurations. 
                            <br><br>
                            <h4>What materials can be forged?</h4>
                            Most steel grades can be forged. Ferrous steel materials that can be forged include mild steel, carbon steel, stainless steel, and iron. Non-Ferrous steels that can be forged include bronze, copper, aluminum, and titanium. 
                            <br><br>
                            <h4>What quantities become economical for forgings?</h4> 
                            There are several factors to consider when thinking about purchasing forgings. 1. In order to produce a forging, KDK creates a die with the impresssion of the desired forging shape. 2. Die charges for new parts can typically cost several thousand dollars. Unless an impression die has been already been created, a new die will be needed. The cost of the forging die is amortized over the number of forgings needed, to determine if creating a forging is viable. 3. With certain components, strength that comes from forged steel grain flow is required.  These components are required to be forged. 
                            <br><br>
                            <h4>What industries use forgings?</h4>
                            Many industries use forgings. For example, the automotive industry uses forgings in powertrain and chassis components.  Aircraft often have forged landing gear components and other engine components. Along with these, many other industrial sectors use forgings. Forgings are even found in everyday places around us. 
                            Many hand tools used in dental and medical offices are forgings.

                            <h4>What is the ownership of KDK?</h4>
                            KDK is privately owned and has been since its founding. KDK began as a defense industry supplier after WWII in 1947. Our company made torsion bars for military tanks as the United States built up its war armaments.
