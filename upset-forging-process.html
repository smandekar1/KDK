                        <p><h3>Process Features</h3><br>
                        <li>Ideal in situations where a large mass is desired on a long rod</li>
                        <li>Saves material</li>
                        <li>Reduces area that needs to be forged</li>
                        <li>Improved grain flow adds strength to components</li>
                        <br><br>

                        <h3>Process Description</h3><br>
                        The upset forging process typically involves heating one end of a steel bar and forging this end.  There is no need to heat the entire bar as the unheated steel will not be forged.   

                        <br><br>Horizontal forging machines, often called upsetters or hot heading machines, are used to enlarge the cross section of the forging stock and often are used to shape the stock simultaneously.  A forging machine grips the material to be upset between a stationary die and a movie die.  The moving die locked into position against the stationary die by means of a toggle mechanism in the forging machine during the forging sequence.  
                        <br><br>A punch or heading too is then introduced through an opening or series of openings between the gripper dies.  The pressure of the punch acting on the end of the forging stock held between the gripper dies causes the stock to upset, filling the cavity in the gripper dies and, in some instances, a cavity in the punch itself.  <br><br>An upset forging can be produced by using a series of progressive impressions, typically between one and five.  The number of impressions, or passes, is dependent upon the amount of upset required and the maximum diameter of bar stock that can be upset in one pass is directly related to the length of unsupported stock beyond the gripper dies.  If the length of the unsupported bar stock is more than three times the diameter, the bar stock tends to buckle rather than upset. 

                        <br><br>   
                        
                        <br><br>The upset forging process adds strength to the steel because the grain flow structure is improved. KDK will make a custom die for your forging needs. Please send us a copy of your drawing and we will be happy to review your part and send a quote to you.<br><br>
