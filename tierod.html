                        The tie rod connects the center link to the steering knuckle on cars that have conventional suspensions. The tie rod connects to the end of the rack in rack and pinion steering systems. The tie rod transfers force from the steering center link or rack gear to the knuckle, causing the wheel to turn. The outer tie rod end connects with and sleeve, allowing the tie rod to be adjustable. This adjusts the vehicle's toe, an angle alignment measure.
