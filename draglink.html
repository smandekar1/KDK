                        <h3>Product Description</h3><br>

                        KDK manufactures Drag links in a variety of shapes and sizes The head diameter or   cup shapes vary in size from approximately 1.5 inch to 3 inches in diameter. The   lengths of drag links can range from 12 inches to 2 feet in length. We can customize   drag links per your specifications. We can also provide finished machined sockets as  well as unfinished sockets for you to machine, grind, or assemble. Drag links   typically have 1 or more bends in the forging or perhaps diamonds that are   included  at a location along the bar. KDK can make all tooling for the various bends in the forging as well as for the boss or diamond applications. Our drag links are able to be finished with bearings and grease fittings. We offer sandblasting, heat treating services, and e-coating on our drag links. These can aid in the appearance and machinability of the drag link forgings. The forging process adds strength to the steel bar as opposed to casting end fittings from a bar. Improved grain flow which is achieved as a result of this process provides strength that can be view from a microscope. Depending on your requirements, KDK will make a custom die for your forging needs. Please send us a copy of your drawing and we will be happy to review your part and send a quote to you.<br><br>
