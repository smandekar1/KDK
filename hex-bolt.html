                        <h3>Product Description</h3><br>

                        There are a variety of press parts anbd closed die forgings that KDK produces.  This size of our press parts typically can go up to 4 1/2".  These forged can be supplied in an as forged condition, sand blasted, or heat treated to customer specifications.  KDK produces closed die forgings in production quantities.  Many customers choose to have their components forged for added strength and durability.  The forging process also reduces material costs and is eco-friendly as less steel is used for the component.  Much of the steel used comes from recycled sources.    

                        The forgings process adds strength to the steel as opposed to castings or machining from the bar. Improved grain flow which is achieved as a result of this process provides strength that can be viewed from a microscope. Depending on your requirements, KDK Forging will make a custom die for your forging needs. Please send us a copy of your drawing and we will be happy to send a quote to you.  <br><br>
