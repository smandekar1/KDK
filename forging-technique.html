                        <h3>Forging Techniques</h3><br>
                        There are several different kinds of forging techniques used in the production of parts.  We will exclude hand forging techniques which are common but are limited to mainly the craft and non industrial market.  

                        The main forging techniques that are used in the production of industrial components are open die forging, closed die forging, ring rolled forging, cold forging, rotary forging, and upset forging.  

                        A few of the techniques are described below.  
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>Open Die Forging</h3><br>

                        Open die forging is performed between flat dies that have no profile in them.  The hot forged billet is formed by manipulating the billet between these two flat dies and the pressure of the forging machine brings these two dies together.  Very large parts, in excess of 200,000 lbs. can be produced through the open die forging process. 

                        The process is call open-die because the metal laterally from dies, the process works progressively by hammering the stock into the desired shape.  After the first set of passes, the part may be flipped over to flatten the untouched surfaces. <br><br>  


                        <h3>Closed Die Forging</h3><br>

                        Closed die forging, or impression die forging presses metal between to dies that contain a precut profile of the desired part.  Either a single forging or many forgings can be forged using this type of process.  A limitless variety of 3-D shapes can be formed through use of the forging process.  Drop hammer forging machines can produce in excess of 40,000 tons of forging pressure.  As the name implies, in the closed die forging process, the entire component is placed and formed within dies.  There may be two or more dies containing impressions of the part shape and these dies are brought together with the force of the forging machine.  Because metal flow is controlled by the die shape, this process can produce very complex shapes and close tolerances.  Addition secondary forging operations may also be carried out through the use of bending prior to forging in the finish dies. <br><br>  


                        <h3>Upset Forging</h3><br>   

                        The upset forging process typically involves heating one end of a steel bar and forging this end. There is no need to heat the entire bar as the unheated steel will not be forged.

                        Horizontal forging machines, often called upsetters or hot heading machines, are used to enlarge the cross section of the forging stock and often are used to shape the stock simultaneously. A forging machine grips the material to be upset between a stationary die and a movie die. The moving die locked into position against the stationary die by means of a toggle mechanism in the forging machine during the forging sequence.

                        A punch or heading too is then introduced through an opening or series of openings between the gripper dies. The pressure of the punch acting on the end of the forging stock held between the gripper dies causes the stock to upset, filling the cavity in the gripper dies and, in some instances, a cavity in the punch itself.

                        An upset forging can be produced by using a series of progressive impressions, typically between one and five. The number of impressions, or passes, is dependent upon the amount of upset required and the maximum diameter of bar stock that can be upset in one pass is directly related to the length of unsupported stock beyond the gripper dies. If the length of the unsupported bar stock is more than three times the diameter, the bar stock tends to buckle rather than upset.  For more information on the capabilities of the upset forging process, please see the parts tab. <br><br>


                        <h3>Cold Forging</h3><br>   

                        While most forging work is done hot, at temperatures up to 2300 degrees Fahrenheit, cold forging is done without heat.  Cold forging includes many processes including, bending, cold drawing, heading, coining, and extruding.  Typically cold forging temperatures are under a few hundred degrees.  

                        Cold forging is most cost-effective for parts weighing less than 10 lbs.  This is due to the high force required to change the forging shape without heat.  In the cold forging process, a lubricated slug is forced into a closed die under high pressure.  The metal then flows into the die to form the desired shape.  The process can be used to decrease the diameter and increase the bar length.  Extrusions and step extrusions can also be performed using the cold forging process.  Step extrusions can greatly reduce the need for finish machining on the parts. <br><br>
