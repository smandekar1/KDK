                        <h3>Process Flow</h3><br>

                        <h4>Cutting</h4>
                        The shaft forging process typically begins with the cutting of steel material.  This process can be done with a saw or with a shear.  Saw cuts tend to be more precise creating a higher quality forging.  
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Heating</h4>
                        The cut steel bars are then heated using an induction heater.  Gas furnaces may also be used to bring the bars up to the desired forging temperature.  Induction heating coils tend to create a bar with less surface scale on them.  Again, this creates a higher quality forging at the end of the process.  
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Forging</h4>
                        KDK uses horizontal upsetting machines that are able to forge sections of the shaft without touching other sections.  Since only one end of the shaft is typically forged, the length of the shaft can be very long.  Shafts as long as 15 feet are not uncommon at our facility.  
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Die Design</h4>
                        Dies are created using 3D CAD/CAM software that allow forgings to be produced with the tightest of tolerances.  Simulations can also be run using these CAD/CAM systems to determine the feasibility of the forging process.  Dies are then machined in house using our machining centers and an appropriate amount of machining stock is created in the forging.<br><br>  

                        <h4>Secondary Operations</h4>    
                        After the forging process, shaft forgings may be ground and then sandblasted to create a smooth finish for the machining process.  Forging shafts may also be heat treated as needed based on the material and desired hardness.  
                        <br><br>  
                        
                        The upset forging process adds strength to the steel because the grain flow structure is improved. KDK will make a custom die for your forging needs. Please send us a copy of your drawing and we will be happy to review your part and send a quote to you.<br><br>

                        <h3>Experience</h3><br>
                        KDK has been producing shaft forgings for over 70 years. Leading automotive companies that rely on quality components  choose KDK as their shaft supplier.<br><br>
