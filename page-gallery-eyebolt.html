                        <h3>Product Description</h3><br>

                        Eye bolts are small screw forgings that have a loop on one end and are threaded   on the other end. Eye bolts are commonly used to attach lines to objects. For   example the can be used to attach a cable to the back of a painting to allow the   painting to hang from a nail on a wall. For more of an industrial application, eye   bolts can be used to hang various industrial hooks on attach rope or chain to. KDK   manufactures many different types of eye bolts in a variety of shapes and sizes. The  diameters of these eyes can range from ½ inch to 3 ½ inches. The length can range from 4 inches to 36 inches. The thread on the eye bolt can be custom made to customer specifications as well. There are many standard sizes of eye bolts. Chances are that KDK already has a die to accommodate the product that you are looking for. Heat treating and sandblasting services are also available. This can aid in the appearance of eye bolts. Plating specifications are also completed for our customers. The forging process adds strength to the steel bar as opposed to casting ends that may be welded. Improved grain flow which is achieved as a result of this process provides strength that can be viewed from a microscope. Depending on your requirements, KDK will make a custom die for your forgings needs. Please send us a copy of your drawing and we will be happy to review your part and send a quote to you.<br><br>
